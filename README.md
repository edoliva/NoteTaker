## Criteria

## Usage/coding:
- This application was written to allow for a clean user experience. The general logic is as follows:
   - The reop contains a server.js file to get and post requests.
   - There is a route directory to handle the requests.
   - The public directory contains the CSS, HTML, and JS files provided at the start.

## Screenshots

Delete coding using For loop/If statement /ForIn loops. There was likley a more prefered option, but I wanted to practice these JS commands:
